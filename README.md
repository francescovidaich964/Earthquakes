In this project we are going study a dataset of earthquakes occurred in a time window of almost 30 years in South California. The catalog includes the magnitude, time of occurrence (s), and 3D coordinates (m) of each earthquake.

Interactive presentation:  	Earthquakes_notebook.ipynb

Module with all codes: Earthquakes.py

Main investigation: to study how the waiting time distribution between two consecutive earthquakes depends on the minimum magnitude considered (e.g. if we consider only earthquakes of magnitude 5 or greater we expect to wait longer times between two events, but how much longer than for example if we consider those of magnitude 4 or greater?).

Main achievement: detected waiting-time scaling property (and critical exponent) w.r.t. the magnitude threshold above which the earthquakes are considered.
