1) index of the event
2) index of the previous event that triggered it (defined with a given algorithm), -1 if no ancestor is found
3) time (sec.) from 0:00 of Jan.1st, 1982
4) magnitude
5,6,7) 3D coordinates (meter) of the earthquake hypocenter, i.e. of the point from where it started. These Euclidean coordinates are derived from latitude, longitude and depth.

Joining each event to that with the index of the second column (if not -1), there emerges a set of causal trees.
